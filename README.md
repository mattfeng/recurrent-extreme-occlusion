# 6.804 Computational Cognitive Science Final Project

## Evaluation

Since CORnet-\* output 1000 classes corresponding to the 1000 ImageNet classes,
whereas the Vehicle Occlusion dataset (source: ) is based on PASCAL3D+, we need
to map the 1000 classes to the corresponding six vehicle in the PASCAL3D+ dataset.

Using the 1000 class indices from ImageNet from https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a, we set the following mapping from PASCAL3D+ to ImageNet.
